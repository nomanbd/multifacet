These are some example files that might help get you started.

schema.xml and solrconfig.xml describe the Solr index we are using at this
time.  There are things in there that aren't being used, and some tweaks to
field types, particularly the addition of KStem instead of Porter, as KStem is
a less aggressive stemmer.  More info here:

vufind_templates.php and vufind.inc are very rudimentary examples for using
MULtifacet as the UI for an existing VUFind-generated Solr index.  Copying
vufind_templates.php into multifacet/multifacet_templates.php, and vufind.inc
into multifacet/multifacet.inc would get you started, but more work would still
need to be done to get it fully functional.  If you happen to work on more
complete versions of these callbacks and files, we'd love to include them with
the project.
