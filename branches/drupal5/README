Introduction
------------
MULtifacet is a Drupal 5 module that wraps a UI around an arbitrary Solr index.
It shares many features with other Solr-based OPAC projects, including faceted
search results, SMS/email output, RefWorks integration, user tagging,
saving/exporting of records, RSS feeds, Zotero support, Google Books
images/linking, "more like this", formatted citation output (via the WorldCat
API), COinS, unAPI, etc. While developed for, and initially targeted at,
library collections, there's no reason it couldn't put a UI on other Solr
indexes that need similar features. There's a bit of ajax, but it should
degrade gracefully.

This module is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License,
version 3.  Other external libraries are provided with their accompanying
licenses.

MULtifacet is developed by Miami University Libraries.

Requirements
------------
- Drupal5; MySQL, or PostgreSQL
- an accessible Solr index
- an up-to-date copy of jquery.js; currently tested with 1.2.6
- SolrPHPClient (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-341)
- PEAR Pager module (http://pear.php.net/package/Pager)

Step-by-Step
------------
These steps should be performed on a dedicated test installation of Drupal,
preferably one that closely matches the one you have in production.  Some steps
might still be a bit strange, so you definitely don't want to break your real
setup.

) Get a Solr index installed, configured, tested, and loaded with data.

) While in the appropriate modules/ directory for your Drupal installation, get
the source code:

    svn co http://multifacet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ multifacet

) As mentioned in the requirements, MULtifacet uses the SolPHPClient to connect
to Solr.  If you don't already have this installed, extract Apache.tar in the
multifacet/ directory.

) Replace the Drupal-provided misc/jquery.js with a up-to-date jquery.js.  Yes,
this needs to be handled better, and could possibly break other modules in your
Drupal installation.  MULtifacet has been tested with version 1.2.6, in
particular.

) Configure multifacet/multifacet.inc.  More details below.

) Enable the module in the Drupal admin tools. MULtifacet is currently found in
the "Other" category.

) Enable/place the provided blocks: MULtifacet Quick Search, MULtifacet Facets,
and MULtifacet Marked Records.

) Enable/place the provided menu items.

) Enable roles' access.

Configuration
-------------
The core configuration is done in multifacet.inc.  Some examples: the Solr host
details, what fields to search (and how they are searched), faceting info, keys
for external APIs, results-per-page, proxy info, and other default values.

Some of the other important options are the  *_callback settings.  These should
be set to names of functions which receive a Solr document, and return a format
for rendering, whether that be for the screen, RSS, SMS, email, or unAPI.
Define your custom *_callback functions in multifacet_templates.php.

Edit multifacet.css for any styling changes.

Please Note
-----------
Records are not stored as nodes like they are in the Millenium Integration
(http://drupal.org/project/millennium) and SOPAC2 (http://thesocialopac.net/)
projects. This means you won't have the option of using records as first-class
Drupal citizens, and take advantage of the various (and great) node-oriented
features.  The combination of CCK and the apachesolr module
(http://drupal.org/project/apachesolr) is a very powerful one, but it's
different than this module.
